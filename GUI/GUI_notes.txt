I suggest we take the genre for all the movies from https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/ 
so that our interface not only performs great Apriori recommendations, but can also offer 
alternatives if the title is not in our list.
Furthermore, we should also make sure that the input field is flexible in recognizing variations of the
input as movie titles.
